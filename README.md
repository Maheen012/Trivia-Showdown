## System Architechture
- Server Side: handles game state, game logic, question management, and multi-client communication
- Client Side: provides the user interface and handles input/output through network sockets

### Socket Communication
- The server listens for incoming connections, utilizing ServerSocket and for each client, creates a new thread (ClientHandler)
- The client uses Socket to connect to the server and listens for messages on a background thread, updating the UI via Platform.runLater().

### Threading
- ClientHandler (server): Each client connection is handled in a separate thread, enabling support for multiple players in parallel
- GameClient (client): Listens for server updates on a background thread, ensuring the GUI remains responsive during gameplay.

### File I/O - CSV Question Loading
- Questions and answers are stored in QuesAns.csv under the resources directory
- The GameLogic class reads this CSV file on the server side and uses the Question model to structure the content
- Dynamic question sets rather than hardcoding

### Build Tools - Maven
- Our pom.xml file is used for:
  - Compiling & config
  - Dependencies - OpenCSV, JavaFX UI Framework
  - Build Automation - for MainMenu class

### User Interface
- The User Interface has been split up in a modular format - rather than all in one UI class
- Consists of: MainMenu, GameLobby, Question Screen, Scoreboard, Theme
* All UI updates from background threads use Platform.runLater() to ensure thread-safe updates to JavaFX elements.

### Client Side Summary
- MainMenu: entry point with UI for player name input and room creation/joining
- GameLobby: displays players in the room and shows the "Start" button for the host
- Question Screen: shows each trivia question, question number, answers, timers, submission, and player name
- Scoreboard: displays final scores and winner and andles result screen transitions
- Theme: applies visual styles/themes across the UI
- GameClient: the core of client logic is contained here. It manages socket communication with specific messages, updates UI using Platform.runLater() when server messages are received

### Server Side Summary 
- GameServer: listens on a port, accepts new clients, and maintains game rooms.
- ClientHandler: manages each client connection, processes incoming commands and messages and sends messages back to clent, also manages room creation and joining
- GameRoom: manages the specifics of the game room (after game is started): players, scores, current questions.
- GameLogic: loads and manages questions, tracks question flow.
- Question: class that represents a single trivia question with the answer options
